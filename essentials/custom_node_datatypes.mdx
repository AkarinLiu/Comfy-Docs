title: "Data Types"
---

These are the most important built in data types. You can also define your own, a concept we'll explore later. {/* TODO link when written */} 

Almost all data types are specified (in `INPUT_TYPES`) by a string. But we'll start with the one exception: `COMBO`

## COMBO

* Additional parameters: None
* Python data type `str`

Represents a dropdown menu widget. 
Unlike other datatypes, `COMBO` it is not specified in `INPUT_TYPES` by a `str`, but by a `list[str]` 
corresponding to the options in the dropdown list. The first option is the default selection.
It does not require the additional parameters dictionary; if one is included it is silently ignored.

`COMBO` inputs are often dynamically generated at run time. For instance, in the built-in `CheckpointLoaderSimple` node, you find 
```
"ckpt_name": (folder_paths.get_filename_list("checkpoints"), )
```
or they might just be a fixed list of options,
```
"play_sound": (["no","yes"], {}),
```

## INT

* Additional parameters: 
    * `default` is required
    * `min` and `max` are optional
* Python data type `int`

## FLOAT

* Additional parameters: 
    * `default` is required
    * `min`, `max`, `step` are optional
* Python data type `float`

## STRING

* Additional parameters: 
    * `default` is required
* Python data type `str`

## IMAGE

- No additional parameters
- Python data type `torch.Tensor` with shape [B,H,W,C]

A batch of `B` images, height `H`, width `W`, with `C` channels (generally `C=3` for `RGB`). 


## LATENT

- No additional parameters
- Python data type `dict`

The `dict` passed contains the key `samples`, which is a `torch.Tensor` with shape [B,C,H,W] representing 
a batch of `B` latents, with `C` channels (generally `C=4` for existing stable diffusion models), height `H`, width `W`. 

The height and width are 1/8 of the corresponding image size (which is the value you set in the Empty Latent Image node).

Other entries in the dictionary contain things like latent masks which need to be documented!
{/* TODO need to dig into this */}
 {/* TODO new SD models might have different C values? */}

## MASK

- No additional parameters
- Python data type `torch.Tensor` with shape [H,W] or [B,C,H,W]

<Warning>MASK tensors have two possible shapes, both of which are different from IMAGE tensors</Warning> {/* TODO document a set of methods to interconvert */}

## About torch.Tensor

Documentation for [torch.Tensor](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html)

## Other data types

There are a number of more technical datatypes for stable diffusion models. The most significant ones are `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE` and `CONDITIONING`.
Working with these is (for the time being) beyond the scope of this guide! {/* TODO but maybe not forever */}
