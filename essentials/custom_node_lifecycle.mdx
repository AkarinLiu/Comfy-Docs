While you can install custom nodes yourself, most people use [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) to install them.

### Installing ComfyUI Manager

#### Using the Command Line

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git
```

Restart Comfy afterwards.

### How Custom Nodes are Installed

<Steps>
<Step title="Git Clone">
The Manager will git clone the repository.
</Step>
<Step title="Install Python Dependencies">
 
It will install the pip dependencies listed in the custom node repository under `requirements.txt`.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</Step>
<Step title="Run Install Script">

Manager will execute `install.py`, if it is present in the custom node repository.

</Step>
</Steps>
### Disable

When a custom node is disabled, the Manager will run `disable.py`, if present in the custom node repository. A `disabled` prefix will be added to the directory of the custom node to disable it.

### Enable

When a custom node is enabled, the Manager will run `enable.py` in the custom node repository.
