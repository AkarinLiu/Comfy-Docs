## How Custom Nodes are Loaded

When Comfy starts, it will scan every python module in the `custom_nodes` directory. If the module exports `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS`, it will be loaded as a custom node.

To install a custom node, all you need to do is include the code under the `custom_nodes` directory, and restart Comfy.

## Installing Custom Nodes

While you can install custom nodes yourself, most people use [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) to install them.

### Installing ComfyUI Manager

#### Using the Command Line

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git
```

Restart Comfy afterwards.

### How Custom Nodes are Installed

<Steps>
<Step title="Git Clone">
The Manager will git clone the repository.
</Step>
<Step title="Install Python Dependencies">
<Warning>It is possible to have pip conflicts. </Warning>
It will install the pip dependencies listed in the custom node repository under `requirements.txt`.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</Step>
<Step title="Run Install Script">

Manager will execute `install.py`, if it is present in the custom node repository.

</Step>
</Steps>
### Disable

When a custom node is disabled, the Manager will run `disable.py`, if present in the custom node repository. A `.disabled` suffix will be added to the directory of the custom node to disable it.

When loading custom nodes, Comfy will skip any directory with a `.disabled` suffix.

In [nodes.py](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/master/nodes.py#L1922C38-L1922C46):
```python
if module_path.endswith(".disabled"): continue
```


### Enable

When a custom node is enabled, the Manager will run `enable.py` in the custom node repository.
